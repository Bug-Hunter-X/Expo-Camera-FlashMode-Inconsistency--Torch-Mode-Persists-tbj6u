This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera settings. Specifically, when setting the `flashMode` to `torch` and subsequently trying to switch to `off` or `auto`, the flash may remain on, even after setting the `flashMode` to the desired value.  This is inconsistent and causes unexpected behavior. The issue seems related to how Expo handles the underlying camera hardware, possibly a race condition or incorrect state management.  The Camera component does not reliably reflect the actual flash state.
